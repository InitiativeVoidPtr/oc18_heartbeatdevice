ARM mbed Client Classic
=======================

This repository contains ARM mbed Client Classic. You should not use this repo directly. This repo is the mbed
Client team's working area and we publish the official, tested versions as part of [mbed Client](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client).

If you want to see an example application - a better starting point would be the [mbed OS example client](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-example-client).
